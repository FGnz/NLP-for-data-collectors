    "# Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is perhaps the most fundamental information processing task. It consists of converting an input to a discrete set of one or more outputs. We perform classification when we take a job title and assign an occupation code, we perform classification when we look at a survey response and deem it \"acceptable\", or \"error, requiring further follow up\", and we perform classification when we examine two records from different data sets and determine that they describe the \"same\" individual, or \"different\" individuals. Classification tasks are everywhere in data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many tasks automatic classification is easy. We can easily write a computer program that determines whether a reported employment number is within a specified range, whether a required survey response was provided or not, or whether one number is bigger than another. When tasks involve complicated inputs like natural language, imagery, or sound however, this approach is no longer feasible. If you have enough training data however, there is an approach that works well. Supervised Machine Learning. This is the basis for most of commercial \"Artificial Intelligence\" today, and the focus of this handbook."
