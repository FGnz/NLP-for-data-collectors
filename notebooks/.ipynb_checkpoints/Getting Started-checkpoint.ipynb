    "The programming language used in this course is Python. Since Python is not yet widely used by many economists, statisticians, and social scientists, this deserves some explanation. The short answer is that Python is now clearly the tool of choice, both in research and production, for machine learning and natural language processing, which forms the core of modern data science and the focus of this handbook. You can see evidence of this in the papers from the top machine learning and language processing conferences like ICLR, NIPS, [ACL](http://aclweb.org/anthology/>), where tools are mentioned the overwhelming choice is Python. You can see this too in the tools being taught at the top universities, from Stanford and MIT to Carnegie Melon and Harvard. Python is not merely a research tool. If you look at the tools released by the top companies in data analysis, including Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft, all of these are built first and foremost for Python (see [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/), [MxNET](https://mxnet.apache.org/), [CNTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK), and many others). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you need easy access to advanced statistical tests and easy visualizations, there are still plenty of great reasons to use R, but for machine learning and natural language processing Python is much better, and it's a much better designed programming language too. I think once you take the time to learn it, you will come to the same conclusion that Google, Stanford, MIT, and many others have, for machine learning, natural language processing, and many other techniques of modern data science, Python is the best language currently available. \n",

    "The easiest way to get started with Python is to install the Anaconda distribution from https://www.anaconda.com/download/. I recommend the most recent version of Python (3.6 or higher). Unless  your computer is ancient you will want the 64-bit installer. All of the software is free.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of installing the Python Anaconda distribution is that, in addition to the Python language interpreter itself, you also get many of the libraries we will use extensively, including pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. You can install these libraries separately if you prefer, but it is much easier to get everything bundled together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have downloaded and installed Anaconda, it's time to start your first program. I will describe the process using the Spyder IDE, which is included Anaconda, but more advanced users should feel free to use whatever development environment you prefer. A Python program is ultimately just a text file so any text editor will do."
